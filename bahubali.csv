0,Josiah Teal,Film Threat,Everything a blockbuster should be.
1,Film Companion Staff,Film Companion,"[It] proves Indian cinema can, in fact, be just as imaginative and expansive as its Western counterpart."
2,Panos Kotzathanasis,Asian Movie Pulse,"You will not find many films more entertaining than this one, as you will be impressed, laugh, and spend 158 minutes without even realizing it."
3,Rahul Desai,CatchNews,"I cannot begin to imagine what goes on in the expansive mind of S.S. Rajamouli. It's not often one sits through 160 minutes of an Indian period drama, and continues to sit hoping for the sequel to magically materialise on screen."
4,J Hurtado,ScreenAnarchy,"Baahubali - The Beginning is a film for the child in everyone, the one who wants to believe in heroes and derring-do"
5,Shilpa Jamkhandikar,Reuters,"The film, produced by Karan Johar and Anil Thadani, is an adrenaline rush, a spectacle of the kind we haven't seen from an Indian film-maker before and hopefully it is a sign of good things to come."
6,Shekhar H Hooli,International Business Times,[Baahubali - The Beginning] boasts of an interesting storyline and sterling performances by the lead actors. The film surely catapults Indian cinema to international levels.
7,Nandini Ramnath,Scroll.in,Rajamouli's emphasis on spectacle and grandiloquence doesn't blind him to the necessity of moving the story along.
8,Allan Hunter,Screen International,"A sweeping, breathless, gloriously overblown adventure yarn filled with marketable ingredients, from rip-roaring battle scenes to exotic landscapes, big-hearted romance to cliff-hanging suspense."
9,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,"Has a 'been there, already seen in Hollywood' feel to it."
10,Lisa Tsering,Hollywood Reporter,"Although he isn't as well known to Hindi film fans as that other famously shirtless star Salman Khan, Prabhas has a presence grand enough to transcend language."
11,Mihir Fadnavis,Hindustan Times,"The final scene of Bahubali reminds you that the tale will be concluded in next year's sequel. By the time the credits roll, you're left wishing it would come sooner."
12,Mike McCahill,Guardian,"At each turn, the money's right there on screen, yet what's most striking is how these resources have been marshalled - to enhance, rather than clutter up, the narrative throughline."
13,Rachit Gupta,Filmfare,Bahubali is truly an epic experience.
14,Karthik Pasupulate,The Times of India,"The best part of the film is the elaborate war sequence that plays out in the second half. The ostentatious sets, breathtaking montage shots of the fictional kingdom, and the sheer scale of the battle scene stand out."
15,Gautaman Bhaskaran,Hindustan Times,"Baahubali, despite its epic dimensions -- with a tendency to copy larger-than-life Hollywood heroic tales like Ben-Hur and Troy -- fails at some level to draw us into the narrative."
16,Sukanya Verma,Rediff.com,The first part of the epic leaves behind dollops of rip-roaring entertainment to relish.
17,Baradwaj Rangan,The Hindu,"The best sight of all is that of a filmmaker not, for a second, taking his audience for granted."
18,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,I can't wait for the second part.
19,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,Scale of ambition: gargantuan. Quality of VFX: out of the ordinary. Content: only occasionally gripping. Final impact: pretty strong.
20,Renuka Vyavahare,The Times of India,"Touted as one of the most expensive films to be made in India, this highly anticipated part one of the two-part period epic, manages to enthrall you with its sheer scale and grandeur."
21,Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,The Hindu,"If a spellbinding saga is what you go looking for, some portions can leave you underwhelmed. The writing could have been better. Yet, there's so much to root for."
22,Josiah Teal,Film Threat,A compelling continuation for our characters without alienating what made fans love the first one. 
23,Stutee Ghosh,The Quint,"Expectations can be tricky. The greater the frenzy over a film, the higher the chances that the film will appear dull in comparison. Luckily for us all, Baahubali 2 manages to live up to the weight of our massive expectations. Go for this one."
24,Sucharita Tyagi,Film Companion,"Right from the opening credits, you know you're in for a treat."
25,Baradwaj Rangan,Film Companion,"Rajamouli gives us one memorable moment after another -- it's not just about grandeur in the sets and visuals, it's about grandeur of the imagination."
26,Panos Kotzathanasis,Asian Movie Pulse,"""Baahubali 2"" brings the concept of film to its basics, providing pure entertainment and visual pleasure in full-of-nonsense fashion, in a tactic that allows the spectator to enjoy the film purely, without any need for thought"
27,Rachel Wagner,rachelsreviews.net,"The musical sequences, dancing, battles and everything else are magnetic and wonderful."
28,Rahul Desai,Film Companion,"For all its derivativeness, Baahubali reminds me of what it is to feel like a child again. To look up at the giant screen, all gooey-eyed, waiting to feel small and overawed..."
29,Ed Travis,Cinapse,"It's a hugely entertaining story that builds, ebbs, and flows in such a way that it feels like the Lord Of The Rings of Indian cinema."
30,Josh Hamm,MUBI,"Few films, much less epics of this scale, actually attempt to graft new images upon classical myth and nationalistic history."
31,J Hurtado,ScreenAnarchy,Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is an easy recommendation to film fans looking to expand their horizons.
32,Hemanth Kumar,Firstpost,It's the sheer magic of terrific storytelling combined with a visual grandeur rarely seen in Indian cinema that turns it into an experience that'll be hard to forget anytime soon.
33,Anna M.M. Vetticad,Firstpost,"The Conclusion is a cocktail of fun stunts, attractive stars, grand settings, terrible acting, conflicted attitudes and closeted conservatism."
34,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,The Conclusion is a film that is so in awe of its own grandiose canvas that it tends to lose sight at times of the need for tighter editing and more believable characterization. Just about everything in the film falls prey to the lure of excess.
35,Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,The Hindu,"For the most part, The Conclusion doesn't let us take our eyes off the screen. It's designed to be a cinematic celebration, one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible."
36,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,Baahubali The Beginning was enormously enjoyable. Baahubali The Conclusion comes to life only in bits and pieces and the credit for it should goes to Prabhas.
37,Meena Iyer,The Times of India,Indian cinephiles must salute Rajamouli for his vision and ambition. He once again gives us our Ben Hur and Ten Commandments experience rolled into one.
38,Rachit Gupta,Filmfare,"While it doesn't have the same panoramic adventure of its predecessor, it does make up with grand scale and precise execution. This movie is worth the hype."
39,Manjusha Radhakrishnan,Gulf News (UAE),Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is a colorful amalgamation of hit serials like Game Of Thrones and those archaic Indian mythological series such as Mahabharata or the Ramayna.
40,Virat Nehru,4:3,Rajamouli has achieved something few Indian directors have managed in their careers: he has tapped into the pulse of the Indian sensibility and made a truly pan-Indian film.
41,Shilpa Jamkhandikar,Reuters,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is a worthy conclusion to this epic series. It may not up the ante from the last film, but it doesn't let up on the pace either."
42,Shekhar H Hooli,International Business Times,"[Baahubali 2 is] a routine revenge drama, but what makes the movie spectacular is the grand treatment."
43,Simon Abrams,RogerEbert.com,"The action choreography is exciting, the operatic plot is compelling, and there's a genuine sense of optimism that undercuts the gouts of blood and thunderous sound effects."
44,Udita Jhunjhunwala,Scroll.in,"A film that is large on emotion, drama, and action with a few extravagant battle scenes, some flying ships and SS Rajamouli's flights of fancy."
45,Dipanjan Sinha,Hindustan Times,"Baahubali is a delight for all those who enjoy cinema as a visual medium... there is not much else, though."
46,Mike McCahill,Guardian,"Here, once again, is thunderous spectacle unlikely to be surpassed in several summers, and clinching proof of writer-director SS Rajamouli's position among world cinema's boldest imagemakers."
